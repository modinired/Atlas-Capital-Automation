'''# Script Launcher Pro

**PhD-quality, world-class, production-ready Python script launcher interface.**

This application provides a comprehensive solution for managing and executing Python scripts through multiple interfaces: a modern graphical user interface (GUI), a powerful command-line interface (CLI), and a REST API for programmatic access by coding agents.
