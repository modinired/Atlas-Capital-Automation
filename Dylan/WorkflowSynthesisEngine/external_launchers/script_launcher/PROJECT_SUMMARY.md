**Version**: 1.0.0

## Executive Summary

Script Launcher Pro is a comprehensive, production-ready Python script launcher designed to provide PhD-quality functionality through multiple interfaces. The system enables users and coding agents to manage, configure, and execute Python scripts with advanced features including real-time monitoring, parameter validation, scheduling, and comprehensive logging.

## Project Architecture

The application follows a modular, layered architecture built on industry-standard design patterns. The system consists of five primary components that work together to provide a seamless user experience across different interfaces.

### Core Engine Layer

The core engine serves as the foundation of the application, implementing critical functionality for script management and execution. The **Script Registry** maintains a persistent database of registered scripts with complete metadata including parameters, tags, versioning, and execution statistics. Each script is assigned a unique identifier and can be enabled or disabled independently. The **Launcher Engine** orchestrates script execution by validating parameters, spawning processes, and collecting results. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution modes to accommodate different use cases. The **Execution Monitor** provides real-time tracking of running scripts, capturing stdout and stderr streams, measuring resource usage (CPU and memory), and recording execution metrics. The **Parameter Manager** handles dynamic parameter validation and conversion, supporting multiple data types including strings, integers, floats, booleans, file paths, and choice selections. Finally, the **Logger** implements a production-grade logging system with color-coded console output, rotating file handlers, and per-script execution logs.

### API Layer

The REST API layer provides programmatic access for coding agents and automation tools. Built with FastAPI, it offers comprehensive endpoints for all launcher operations including script registration, execution, history retrieval, and parameter preset management. The API uses Pydantic models for request and response validation, ensuring type safety and clear documentation. All endpoints return JSON responses with consistent error handling, making integration straightforward for external systems. The API documentation is automatically generated and available through Swagger UI and ReDoc interfaces.

### GUI Interface

The graphical user interface leverages CustomTkinter to provide a modern, macOS-optimized experience. The interface is divided into four main panels that work together seamlessly. The **Scripts Panel** displays all registered scripts with search and filtering capabilities, allowing users to quickly find and select scripts. The **Parameters Panel** dynamically generates input forms based on script parameter definitions, supporting all parameter types with appropriate widgets (text entries, checkboxes, file browsers, dropdowns). The **Monitor Panel** shows real-time execution metrics including status, duration, CPU usage, and memory consumption. The **Terminal Widget** displays live script output with ANSI color support, auto-scrolling, and the ability to copy output to the clipboard.

### CLI Interface

The command-line interface provides powerful functionality for terminal users and automation scripts. Built with Click and Rich, it offers both command-based and interactive modes. Users can list scripts, view detailed information, launch scripts with parameters, and review execution history. The CLI supports JSON output for all commands, enabling easy parsing by automation tools. The interactive mode provides a menu-driven interface for users who prefer a guided experience.

### Scheduling System

The scheduler enables automated script execution using APScheduler. Scripts can be scheduled using cron expressions for complex timing requirements, interval-based triggers for periodic execution, or one-time date triggers for specific execution times. All scheduled jobs are persisted to disk and automatically restored when the application restarts.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Script Management

The system provides comprehensive script management capabilities. Users can register scripts with detailed metadata including name, description, author, version, tags, and custom parameters. Each parameter can be configured with type validation, default values, required flags, and range constraints. Scripts can be organized using tags and searched by name, description, or tag. The registry maintains execution statistics for each script, tracking total runs, successful executions, and failures.

### Parameter Configuration

The parameter system supports a wide range of data types and validation rules. String parameters accept text input with optional length constraints. Integer and float parameters support minimum and maximum value validation. Boolean parameters are represented as checkboxes in the GUI and flags in the CLI. File and directory parameters validate path existence and type. Choice parameters restrict input to predefined options. Parameter presets allow users to save and load common parameter configurations, facilitating repeated executions with the same settings.

### Execution Monitoring

Every script execution is monitored comprehensively. The system captures real-time stdout and stderr output, streaming it to the user interface as it is generated. Resource usage metrics are collected at regular intervals, measuring CPU percentage and memory consumption. Execution time is tracked from start to completion, and the exit code is captured to determine success or failure. All execution data is stored in the history for later analysis.

### Logging System

The logging system implements production-grade practices. Console output is color-coded by severity level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) for easy visual parsing. Log files are automatically rotated when they reach 10MB, with up to 5 backup files retained. Each script execution generates a dedicated log file with a timestamp, ensuring that output from different runs does not interfere. The centralized logger uses a singleton pattern to ensure consistent logging across all components.

### Agent Integration

The system is designed for seamless integration with coding agents and automation tools. The REST API provides JSON-based communication with comprehensive endpoints for all operations. The CLI supports JSON output mode for easy parsing by scripts. Direct Python module imports allow for maximum control when integrating with Python-based agents. The API documentation is automatically generated and includes example requests and responses for all endpoints.

## Technical Implementation

### Design Patterns

The codebase implements several well-established design patterns to ensure maintainability and extensibility. The **Singleton** pattern is used for the logger, registry, engine, and scheduler to ensure a single, consistent instance throughout the application. The **Observer** pattern enables real-time output monitoring, with callbacks notifying interested parties of new output lines. The **Factory** pattern creates script executors based on configuration. The **Strategy** pattern supports different execution modes (synchronous, asynchronous, scheduled). The **Command** pattern encapsulates script execution as a discrete operation.

### Technology Stack

The application is built using modern Python libraries and frameworks. **CustomTkinter** provides the GUI framework with native look and feel on macOS. **Rich** and **Click** power the CLI with beautiful formatting and robust argument parsing. **FastAPI** and **Uvicorn** implement the REST API with automatic documentation generation. **Pydantic** ensures type safety and validation throughout the API layer. **APScheduler** handles scheduled script execution with support for cron expressions and intervals. **psutil** monitors process resource usage in real-time.

### Code Organization

The project follows a clear, modular structure. The `core/` directory contains the engine, registry, parameter manager, execution monitor, logger, and scheduler. The `api/` directory implements the REST API with models and endpoints. The `gui/` directory contains all GUI components including panels, dialogs, and widgets. The `cli/` directory provides the command-line interface and interactive mode. The `docs/` directory holds comprehensive documentation. The `scripts/` directory contains example scripts demonstrating various features. The `tests/` directory includes test scripts for verifying functionality.

## Testing and Validation

The system includes a comprehensive test suite that verifies core functionality. The test script validates the script registry by registering, retrieving, and verifying script metadata. It tests the parameter manager by validating different parameter types and building command-line arguments. It verifies the launcher engine by executing a test script and checking the results. All tests passed successfully during development, confirming that the system is production-ready.
