Abstract. We present CESAR-SRC, a production-grade architecture implementing a hierarchical multi-agent system with multi-model arbitration. The main agent (Orchestrator) coordinates domain-specialized droids (Extractor, Validator, Visualizer, Jury, Trinity) to transform raw recordings and documents into validated, enriched, and persisting workflow graphs. A reflection pipeline converts interactions into durable knowledge via FTS-backed storage and LLM-mediated distillation. We formalize agent contracts, arbitration heuristics, and verification conditions.
